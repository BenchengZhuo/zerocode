# It indicates the time taken by Jmeter to create all of the threads needed. If you set 10 seconds as the ramp-up
# period for 5 threads then the JMeter will take 10 seconds to create those 5 threads.
# Also by setting its value to 0 all the threads can be created at once.

#During the ramp up period, say 10 sec, how many requests you want to fire.
#e.g. in 10 secs, I want to fire 20 requests, that means, if you loop 6 times ie loop.count=6
#you fire 20*6=120 per min(10*6=60 sec) i.e. 120*60 = 7200 per hour.

# By specifying its value Jmeter gets to know that how many times a test is to be repeated provided that
